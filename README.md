My little zsh config
====

1. Set up:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/h2rd/.zsh ~/.zsh
    ln -s ~/.zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. Set up zsh as default shell:

   ```bash
   chsh -s /bin/zsh
   ```
   
3. Install Brew:
  
  ```bash
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"
  ```
